# htd-runai: Run:ai from a terminal UI

A how-to for **researchers**. `htd-runai` is a terminal UI (plus a small
command-line mode) on the login node. It sits on top of the `runai` CLI and
`kubectl`. It does the one-time setup for you, shows your quota, submits
workloads and follows them until they run, shells into them, and saves them
as YAML you can submit again.

It runs **as you, with your own Run:ai login**: it can do nothing you could
not do yourself with `runai` and `kubectl` ([`cli-howto.md`](cli-howto.md)).
Every change it makes is a `runai`/`kubectl` command, written to a log.
Image management for administrators is a separate tool
([`htd-images-howto.md`](htd-images-howto.md)).

**Site values used below:**

| What | Value here |
|---|---|
| Login node | `ww1`: `ssh <user>@192.168.65.2` |
| Tool | `/usr/local/bin/htd-runai` (installed by `runai/48-user-access.sh`) |
| Run:ai URL / your login | `https://runai.htd.local`, `<user>@htd.local` |
| Your manifests | `~/runai/` (examples, saved workloads) |
| Manifests submitted from the form | `~/.local/state/htd-runai/submitted/` |
| Log of every action | `~/.local/state/htd-runai/htd-runai.log` (`!` in the TUI) |

## 1. Starting it

```bash
ssh <user>@192.168.65.2
htd-runai                    # opens on Overview, or on Setup if you are not logged in
htd-runai -p phys-astro      # start in a project
htd-runai --setup            # start on the Setup tab
```

It needs a terminal of at least 80×16. A wide one (≥ 110 columns) puts
identity, quota and in-flight workloads on one screen.

## 2. The screen

```

- **Header**: your login, the control plane, how long your current token
  has left (it renews itself), and when the data was last refreshed. The
  data refreshes every 6 s, or every 2 s while something is in flight.
- **Tabs** `1`–`4`: Overview, Workloads, Activity, Setup. The Activity tab
  shows `(n)` workloads in flight; Setup shows `(!n)` items that need
  attention.
- **Project** (`p`): what Overview and Workloads show. It starts at your
  CLI default project. Switching offers to make the new one your default
  (`runai project set`).

---

## 3. Setup: logging in and housekeeping

Tab `4` is the one-time checklist from [`cli-howto.md` §2](cli-howto.md#2-one-time-setup),
checked live:

| Check | Fix (Enter) |
|---|---|
| runai CLI installed | ask an administrator |
| CLI points at this site | `runai config set --cp-url=https://runai.htd.local --auto-update=disabled` |
| Logged in to Run:ai | log in (below) |
| Clock in step with Run:ai | tell an administrator (expired-token errors otherwise) |
| Default project | `runai project set <project>` (pick from yours) |
| kubectl config file | copy the site skeleton to `~/.kube/config` |
| kubectl uses your Run:ai login | `runai kubeconfig set --bypass-validation` |
| kubectl namespace | `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=runai-<project>` |
| kubectl access to your project | `kubectl auth whoami` + `can-i create jobs` (informational) |
| Your manifests folder | copy the guide's examples into `~/runai`, with your UID/GID/user filled in |
| Home directory | free space, permissions, site UID (informational) |

`Enter` fixes the selected item. `A` fixes everything that needs no input,
re-checking between rounds, because some fixes only become possible after
others. `r` re-checks.

**Logging in** (`i`, or Enter on *Logged in*): choose

- *user name and password*: runs `runai login user -u <you>@htd.local` in
  the terminal. Type the password (same as the web UI), press **Enter**, then
  **Enter** again on `[ Submit ]`. htd-runai never sees the password.
- *single sign-on*: runs `runai login remote-browser`. Open the printed URL
  in a browser on your laptop and paste the code back.

After a successful login it does the housekeeping in one go, with a
progress bar: skeleton `~/.kube/config` if missing, `runai kubeconfig set`,
your default project (asks if you have several), and the kubectl namespace.
`o` logs out.

> Ten wrong passwords lock the account for a while. Ask an administrator
> rather than retrying.

## 4. Overview: who you are and your quota

- **You**: name, e-mail, UID/GID and groups (from your Run:ai token),
  token lifetime, site.
- **Your workloads**: counts by phase, and the GPUs, CPUs and memory your
  running workloads hold right now.
- **Quota** for the selected project, one row per node pool (GPU type):

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| bar | GPUs allocated, with `┆` at the guaranteed quota. Green is within quota, yellow is over quota (borrowed idle GPUs, preemptible). |
| alloc / quota / limit | allocated GPUs, guaranteed quota, hard limit (`∞` = none) |
| non-pre | GPUs held by non-preemptible workloads. These must fit in the quota. |
| CPU / memory | allocated across the project's workloads |
| ↳ requested but pending | GPUs asked for that the scheduler has not placed yet |

  Below that: the project's average GPU and GPU-memory utilisation over
  24 h, and its average allocation over 7 days.
- **In flight** (wide terminals): the Activity bars of section 8.

`p` → *(all projects)* lists every project you belong to.

---

## 5. Workloads: query, shell, logs, delete

Tab `2` lists **your** workloads in the project (`★`). `a` toggles to
everyone in the project; `/` filters by name, phase, type or image.
Workloads you created with `kubectl apply` count as yours, even though
Run:ai records no submitter for them. htd-runai remembers what you submitted
through it.

The details pane shows phase and progress bar, why it is pending (the
scheduler's reason), type/category/preemptibility/priority, timings,
requested vs. allocated resources, node pools, images, tool URLs, the
original `runai` command, its pods (node, pool, IP, containers), and the
phases htd-runai has seen with how long each lasted.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `Enter` / `s` | **shell**: `runai workload exec <name> -it -- bash` (falls back to `sh`) in your home directory; asks which pod/container if there are several. `exit` returns. |
| `l` | logs (last 3000 lines) in a pager with `/` search |
| `L` | follow logs live (`runai workload logs -f`); Ctrl-C returns |
| `d` | `runai workload describe` (events, pods, why pending) |
| `y` | save as YAML (section 9) |
| `f` | port-forward a pod port (`kubectl port-forward`); then open `http://localhost:<port>` on the login node, or tunnel it from your laptop with `ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port> <user>@192.168.65.2` |
| `u` / `c` | copy the tool URL / the name to your clipboard (works over ssh in most terminals) |
| `z` | suspend / resume (Run:ai workspaces and trainings) |
| `x` | delete (`runai workload delete`). Services and Ingresses created by `kubectl apply` stay: `kubectl delete -f <file>` removes those. |

---

## 6. Submitting a new workload (the form)

`n` opens a form on the left with a live preview of the manifest on the
right. Use `↑/↓` to move, `Enter` to edit text or open a list, and `←/→`
(or space) to cycle choices.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Project, Name | name: lowercase, digits, `-`, ≤ 63 characters, unique in the project |
| Kind | **batch job**: a `Job` that ends, preemptible (may borrow idle GPUs). **interactive**: a `Job` running `sleep infinity` as a Run:ai *Build* workload, non-preemptible; shell into it with `Enter`. **service**: a `Deployment`. **Run:ai workspace**: `runai workspace submit --environment …`, which keeps the environment's tools and URLs (Jupyter, VS Code, ...). |
| Environment | an environment from the Run:ai catalog; fills image and command |
| Image, Command | command runs as `sh -c "<command>"`; empty = the image's default |
| GPU | none / fraction (`gpu-fraction` annotation) / whole (`nvidia.com/gpu`) |
| Node pool | `any`, or a GPU type (`runai/node-pool` label) |
| CPU cores, Memory | requests = limits |
| Run as me + /home | your UID/GID, NFS `/home` mounted, `HOME` and working directory = your home |
| Scratch, /dev/shm | node-local `emptyDir` at `/scratch` (sets `TMPDIR`), bigger shared memory |
| Env | `A=1,B=2` |
| Completions, Keep after end | batch jobs: parallel indexed pods, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` |
| Priority, Preemptibility | `default` = Run:ai's default for the kind |

Below the fields: GPU used/quota per pool, plus warnings, e.g. the name is
taken, the image is not in the local registry (nodes are offline), or a
non-preemptible GPU request does not fit your free quota and would stay
pending.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `S` | submit; jumps to Activity (section 8) |
| `W` | write the manifest to `~/runai/<name>.yaml` (or the workspace command as a `.sh` script) without submitting |
| `E` | write it, open it in `$EDITOR`, then submit the edited file |
| `Esc` | discard (asks first) |

Priority, preemptibility and category are written into the manifest as
labels. htd-runai passes them to `runai workload submit` as `--priority`,
`--preemptibility` and `--category`, because the CLI does not read them from
the file. A copy of every submitted manifest is kept in
`~/.local/state/htd-runai/submitted/`.

---

## 7. Submitting YAML files

`F` asks for files: names, globs or a directory, with Tab completion, e.g.
`~/runai/0[13]-*.yaml`. It lists what will happen to each file, then
submits them one after the other:

- one object per file: `runai workload submit -f <file> -p <project>`
  (labels → flags, as above);
- several objects (Service, Ingress, ...): `kubectl apply -f <file> -n runai-<project>`.

The project comes from `metadata.namespace: runai-<project>` if the file has
one, otherwise the selected project. Names already taken in the project
(including by an earlier file in the same batch) are reported and skipped.

---

## 8. Activity: progress bars

Tab `3` shows the batch being submitted and every workload in flight:

```
  Submission 2/2  ✔ 2  done
  ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ 100%
   ✔ 01-cpu-job.yaml  runai workload submit  Creating Job hello-cpu...
   ✔ 03-fractional-gpu.yaml  runai workload submit  Creating Job half-gpu...
  ▶ ● half-gpu  phys-astro · Job  Running 2s  GPU 0.5
    ████████████████████████████████████████████████████▓▓█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░  87%
    Submitted          Pending           Starting           Running           Done
    ◐ dev-1101-1336  phys-astro · Job  Pending 4s  - NonPreemptibleOverQuota
    ███████████████▓▓██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  37%
    Submitted          Pending           Starting           Ready
```

- Batch jobs go Submitted → Pending → Starting → Running → **Done**.
  Interactive jobs, services and workspaces end at **Ready** (Running).
- The moving block marks a stage still in progress. Yellow means Pending;
  the scheduler's reason is shown on the line. Red means Failed, at the
  stage it reached.
- It lists what you submitted from this session plus any workload of yours
  that is not settled yet. Finished ones you did not submit here drop off
  after 15 minutes. `D` forgets everything finished.
- `Enter` jumps to the workload in tab 2. `s`, `l`, `L`, `d`, `y`, `x` work
  here too.

---

## 9. Saving a workload as YAML

`y` (tab 2 or 3) writes the selected workload to `~/runai/<name>.yaml`
(you can change the path). The file is a manifest you can submit again:

```yaml
# Job dev-1101-1336 in project phys-astro, saved by htd-runai 2026-11-01 13:36:58
# submit again: runai workload submit -f <this file> -p phys-astro
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: dev-1101-1336
  labels:
    kai.scheduler/preemptibility: non-preemptible
    priorityClassName: low
    run.ai/category: Build
spec:
  backoffLimit: 0
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext: {runAsUser: 5102, runAsGroup: 5100, supplementalGroups: [5100]}
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: 10.10.172.1:5001/workloads/ubuntu:24.04
        command: [sleep, infinity]
        ...
```

It reads the live object with `kubectl get` and strips everything the
cluster added (status, UIDs, owner references, controller labels, injected
`RUNAI_*` variables, scheduler defaults). It keeps what defines the
workload: image, command, resources, GPU annotations, node pool, security
context, volumes, priority/preemptibility/category labels. For workloads
created with `runai workspace submit` or in the UI, the original `runai`
command is added as a comment. If kubectl is not set up (Setup tab), it
falls back to the Run:ai spec of workspaces and trainings: that file is not
a Kubernetes manifest, but carries the command that recreates the workload.

To resubmit: `F` and the file, or `runai workload submit -f ~/runai/<name>.yaml`.
Change `metadata.name` first if the old one still exists.

## 11. Command-line mode

The same functions without the UI, for scripts and quick checks:

```bash
htd-runai status                 # identity, quota bars per pool, your workloads
htd-runai ls                     # your workloads in the default project
htd-runai ls -A                  # everyone's, in all your projects
htd-runai doctor                 # setup checklist (exit 1 if anything is not ok)
htd-runai doctor --fix           # ... and apply the fixes that need no input
htd-runai submit ~/runai/0[13]-*.yaml          # batch submit with a progress bar, then follow
htd-runai submit job.yaml -p phys-astro --no-wait
htd-runai watch [NAME...]        # progress bars until everything has settled (Ctrl-C stops watching)
htd-runai save NAME [-o FILE|-]  # workload -> YAML (default ~/runai/NAME.yaml; --force overwrites)
htd-runai shell NAME             # = runai workload exec NAME -it -- bash
```

Logging in stays interactive: `runai login user -u <you>@htd.local`, or the
TUI.

---

## 12. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `✖ not logged in` in the header | session ended: `i` (or `runai login`) |
| `token is expired` / 401 right after logging in | the login node's clock is off: Setup → *Clock*; tell an administrator |
| Setup: *kubectl access* fails, `whoami` error | `runai kubeconfig set` (Enter on *kubectl uses your Run:ai login*) |
| `runai kubeconfig set`: `open /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml: permission denied` | your shell inherited root's `KUBECONFIG` (`su <user>` without `-`). Log in as yourself (`ssh`, or `su - <user>`). htd-runai ignores such a `KUBECONFIG` and uses `~/.kube/config`; plain `runai`/`kubectl` need `unset KUBECONFIG`. Never use `rke2.yaml`: it is the cluster-admin credential. |
| Save gives a Run:ai spec, not a manifest | kubectl not set up yet (Setup tab) |
| Workload stays Pending with `NonPreemptibleOverQuota` | non-preemptible GPU request above your free quota: Overview, *non-pre* column. Use a batch job or preemptible. |
| `ImagePullBackOff` | image not in `10.10.172.1:5001/workloads/...`; the form warns about this |
| Shell: `I have no name!` prompt | normal: the image has no passwd entry for your site UID; files and `/home` still work as you |
| `kubectl apply` workloads not marked `★` on another machine | ownership of kubectl workloads is remembered per user in `~/.local/state/htd-runai/owned.json` |
| Anything else | `!` shows the log with every command htd-runai ran and its output |

---

## 13. Notes for administrators

- Installed by `runai/48-user-access.sh` (`install -m 755 runai/htd-runai.py
  /usr/local/bin/htd-runai`). Python 3.9 + PyYAML (system packages), no
  other dependencies. It honours `RUNAI_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` and `KUBECONFIG`.
- Reads use the Run:ai REST API with the user's token from
  `runai auth get-token` (an ExecCredential; `status.token`, 15-minute JWT,
  refreshed by the CLI): `/api/v1/org-unit/projects` (quota, per-pool
  status: CPU in millicores, memory in MB), `/api/v1/workloads`,
  `/api/v1/workloads/<id>/pods`, `/api/v1/asset/environment`. Researchers
  get 403 on `/api/v1/node-pools` and `runai nodepool list`, so cluster-wide
  free capacity is not shown.
- The site URL comes from `--cp-url` in `/etc/profile.d/runai-cli.sh`; the
  skeleton kubeconfig and examples from `/usr/local/share/runai`.
- Run:ai 3.0.20 quirks it works around: `runai workload submit -f` ignores
  `priorityClassName` / `kai.scheduler/preemptibility` / `run.ai/category`
  labels (passed as flags instead); workloads created by `kubectl apply`
  have `submittedBy: null`.
- Test hook: `HTD_RUNAI_SCREEN=<file>` writes a plain-text copy of every
  frame (used to test the UI headlessly through a pty).
